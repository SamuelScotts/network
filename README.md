# Network

A social media style platform, framed around the premise of Twitter.

All data currently held on Express server, as no DB has yet been added.

Lots of functionality yet to be added, however you can currently post a message, and/or a comment/reply to that message.

This is not a commercial project, and it is in no way to be used by anyone else.  This was merely done for education and developmental purposes.
